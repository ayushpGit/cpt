      "desc": "Trisara Nepal, a well-known hospitality and established brand tucked away in Nepal's breathtaking landscapes, enlisted our help to improve their online presence and build an engaging website that captures the essence of their services. To create a dynamic and user-friendly website, the team at Crocus Pearl Technologies accepted the challenge and worked closely with Trisara Nepal. The main goals were to emphasize the brand's multi-locational aspect, incorporate features like event pops, an online booking system, a QR system menu, detailed menus with galleries, and showcase Trisara Nepal's accomplishments and community footprint.\n\nWe used a dynamic approach on the website to highlight the variety of Trisara Nepal's offerings across various locations. With a few clicks, users can easily browse the various Trisara Nepal outlets. A dedicated page for each location featured a gallery of breathtaking photos that perfectly captured the distinct charm and beauty of the restaurants. Potential visitors were able to form a strong connection with the various locations thanks to this visually immersive experience, which encouraged them to book their ideal get away place at Trisara Nepal.\n\n For Trisara Nepal, maintaining the website's content was essential because they frequently hosted events and special promotions. We incorporated an 'Event Pops' feature on the website to accomplish this. Users were welcomed by eye-catching pop-up notifications about upcoming events, time-limited deals, and exciting offers as soon as they arrived on the website. In addition to instilling a sense of urgency in users, the event pops improved their browsing experience, which increased event participation and booking.\n\n We seamlessly integrated an online booking system into the website to speed up the booking process and improve customer convenience. Users could quickly check the availability, choose their preferred dates, and securely book reservations through the platform. This user-friendly system made booking simple, fostering potential customers' confidence, and helping Trisara Nepal achieve higher conversion rates.\n\n We implemented a QR system menu for their restaurants as part of Trisara Nepal's dedication to offering cutting-edge dining experiences. Customers could use their smartphones to scan QR codes on the tables in each dining area to access the menu. The interactive menu featured a tempting selection of dishes with thorough descriptions, enticing images, and a list of the ingredients. This invention increased sustainability and provided a more contemporary dining experience while also reducing paper usage and winning over customers with its user-friendly design.\n\n We created a section on the website to highlight Trisara Nepal's accomplishments and community footprint in order to improve their reputation and show their dedication to sustainability and community engagement. We highlighted their environmental initiatives, charitable projects, and beneficial impact on local communities through arresting visuals and compelling narratives. Travelers who are socially conscious found this section to be a potent illustration of Trisara Nepal's values, strengthening the bond between the company and its target market.\n\n The creation of the Trisara Nepal website was a resounding success, improving the brand's online visibility and increasing engagement with its target audience. Our agency's dedication to building a feature-rich, user-friendly website that was in line with Trisara Nepal's values and vision was demonstrated by the integration of multi-location exploration, event pops, online booking, QR system menu, detailed menus with galleries, and achievements/community footprint. The website had a noticeable impact on bookings, user feedback, and brand loyalty, securing Trisara Nepal's place as one of Nepal's top dining and hospitality brands."

One of InVision's initiatives is the Design Forward Fund, a $5 million fund dedicated to investing in the future of design. I'm happy to say that my idea was among several selected for implementation and shortly after the initial interviews, we began shaping requirements for the Basic UX project.\n\nOur goal was to create an extensive library of components and assets to help designers wireframe their web projects faster. Over the course of 5 months I designed more than 400 layout components in 30 categories (each prepared for desktop, tablet & phone screens), 128 icons, 56 user journey map elements and over 100 user interface elements. You can easily customize and combine them when working on your wireframes.\n\nAside from that, I was in touch with the Director of Product and the InVision tech team to report issues and bugs that I found within the software, as well as to propose improvements regarding certain functionalities. It was exciting to see how the product evolved and improved with each update during this short time.\n\nThe final deliverable was a family of 4 products that you can download and use for free. Just download InVision Studio, open their App Store and search for 128 Outline Icons, eCommerce Wireframe Kit, User Interface Kit and Web Wireframe Kit."
