Over the course of 5 months I designed more than 400 layout components in 30 categories (each prepared for desktop, tablet & phone screens), 128 icons, 56 user journey map elements and over 100 user interface elements. You can easily customize and combine them when working on your wireframes./nAside from that, I was in touch with the Director of Product and the InVision tech team to report issues and bugs that I found within the software, as well as to propose improvements regarding certain functionalities.
